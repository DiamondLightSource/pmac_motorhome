Installation Tutorial
=====================

.. note::

    For installation inside DLS, please see the internal documentation on
    ``dls-python3`` and ``pipenv``. Although these instructions will work
    inside DLS, they are intended for external use.

    If you want to contribute to the library itself, please follow
    the Contributing instructions.


Check your version of python
----------------------------

You will need python 3.7 or later. You can check your version of python by
typing into a terminal::

    python3 --version


Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

It is recommended that you install into a “virtual environment” so this
installation will not interfere with any existing Python software::

    python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
    source /path/to/venv/bin/activate


Installing the library
----------------------

You can now use ``pip`` to install the library::

    python3 -m pip install pmac_motorhome

If you require a feature that is not currently released you can also install
from github::

    python3 -m pip install git+git://github.com/DiamondLightSource/pmac_motorhome.git

The library should now be installed and the commandline interface on your path.
You can check the version that has been installed by typing::

    pmac_motorhome --version

Steps to install for development
--------------------------------
- checkout from source control

  - clone git@gitlab.diamond.ac.uk:controls/python3/pmac_motorhome.git
- cd to source root
- pipenv install --dev
- run tests

  - pipenv run pytest
- build an example PLC to /tmp/PLC12_SLITS1_HM.pmc

  - pipenv run python docs/tutorials/example.py
