History of motor home
=====================

This project is an evolution of the homing PLC generator motorhome.py from
Diamond Light Source's pmacUtil module.

TODO elaborate
The generated homing plcs should use the same API as
those generated by the pmacUtil python module, and the
same P-variables to be used.

For the standard homing sequences supported by the original motorhome.py
this module will create exactly the same PLC code.
