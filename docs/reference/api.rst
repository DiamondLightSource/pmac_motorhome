.. _API:

dls_motorhome API
===============================

This is the internal API reference for dls_motorhome

The generated homing plcs should use the same API as
those generated by the pmacUtil python module, and the
same P-variables to be used.

For the standard homing sequences supported by the original motorhome.py
this module will create exactly the same PLC code.
