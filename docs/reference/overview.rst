.. _API_Overview:

Overview
========

This is the external API reference for dls_motorhome. All functions documented
here may be called  directly from a homing PLC definition file. (TODO ref)

The generated homing plcs should use the same API as
those generated by the pmacUtil python module, and the
same P-variables to be used.

For the standard homing sequences supported by the original motorhome.py
this module will create exactly the same PLC code.

The following commands provide a set of predefined sequences that perform
some standard homing sequences. These in turn rely upon snippet functions.
To implement custom homing sequences the user can call the snippet functions
directly and mix them with the standard homing sequences as required.
